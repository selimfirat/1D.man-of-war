# Man of War
CS 319 Project inspired by Pokemon FireRed. This project is a 2d rpg game. This project will be based on dialogs and battles. This role playing game's story will mainly include the adventures of unknown guy which will be less-unknown progressively during the player plays the game. As the player explore the world of our game, new quests will appear. Exploring will be through dialogs and quests mainly consist of battles. As player completes the quests, he/she will earn gold to buy some items and learn new skills. These skills and items will help player to fight better in battles. Also, the player will be aware of the full worldmap through minimap option.


We chose this project because we think that this idea fits well in OOP structure. We will develop this project in Java because we all have
experience in Java language. IntelliJ IDE will be used as a development platform. Final project will be deployed to .JAR through Maven.
